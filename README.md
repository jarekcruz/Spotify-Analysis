# Spotify-Analysis
Brief Spotify user analysis

# Objective
Following the end of a class project, I felt compelled to expand my research on Spotify and its user functions following the exploration of a data set found on Kaggle. I was intrigued by the dataset's statistics on danceability, liveness and speechiness among other factors, and knew that I could use those as a predictive measure in an ML model. I believe that Spotify would use these insights to further push their recommendation system, as well as perhaps using it to be the first to introduce popular music to the general public.
