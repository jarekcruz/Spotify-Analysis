# Spotify-Analysis
Brief Spotify user analysis

# Objective
Following the end of a class project, I felt compelled to expand my research on Spotify and its user functions following the exploration of a data set found on Kaggle. I was intrigued by the dataset's statistics on danceability, liveness and speechiness among other factors, and knew that I could use those as a predictive measure in an ML model. I believe that Spotify would use these insights to further push their recommendation system, as well as perhaps using it to be the first to introduce popular music to the general public.

In this project, I intend to analyze the patterns found within a popular song on Spotify in regards to music-based statistics. I will first utilize MySQL in order to pull data tables, then use Tableau to graph important insights found within the data. Following analysis, I will use python in order to train a Decision Tree model to predict a song's popularity score, given a slew of factors regarding its composition.

# Dataset
The dataset was found on Kaggle, and features songs from 125 genres. The columns I will focus on especially are the popularity column, which is a algorithm-based value from 0-100 based on the total number of plays for the track, as well as the recency of said plays. It also accounts for artist popularity. I will also analyze statistics in the danceability, energy, tempo and valence categories, and will cross compare between both explicit and clean music.
